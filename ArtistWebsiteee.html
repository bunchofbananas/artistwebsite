<div class="content-item full-text">
    <p> This performance was built around a unique and precious material: Nile silt—rich clay harvested from the riverbanks, darkened by manganese and millennia of organic matter.
        I balanced in a plank position on sharp bricks made from this clay, a brick under each hand and foot. Below me, roses from Morocco. The strain set in, the bricks cracked, and at the three-minute mark, they gave way. The light went out as I fell, crushing the roses beneath me.

<h4>Droughtstick 2018</h4>

<div class="content-item full-text">
    <p> Originally designed as an autonomous, sound-reactive kinetic sculpture, the piece was a wooden box (part instrument, part dysfunctional plinth) filled with shells and seeds, meant to roll and tumble gracefully in response to the levels of sound in a room. But during its unveiling, the mechanics failed. Instead of quiet precision, the box lurched and jammed unpredictably. 

        I was forced to intervene, scrambling to keep it moving, my own frantic energy reflecting its struggle. A machine failing at autonomy, an artist failing at detachment.

                                <br><br> With support from <em>Jeunes Volontaires</em> and <em>Conseil des arts et lettres du Québec</em>, the collective organized sixteen free site-specific events, activating parks and overlooked spaces with performance, painting, theatre, sculpture, fibre arts, installation, and food. </p>
